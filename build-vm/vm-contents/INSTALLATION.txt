The following instructions were obtained from the original git repository authored by Ivan Beschastnikh and colleagues.
***************************************************************************************************************************************

Here's how you install Synoptic from the source repository:

(1)Make sure that you have installed a copy of JRE 7 or higher and that the java command is in your path.

(2)First, you will need to check out the Synoptic source code repository (warning: it is over 250MB).

(3)(i)Next, you can build Synoptic from the command line with ant, or build it from within Eclipse (a Java IDE).

Building from the command line (simpler):

    Assuming that you checked out the code into synoptic/, there will be a top-level synoptic/build.xml file for ant to build all of the projects in the repository.
    Run ant synoptic inside the synoptic/ directory to build synoptic and all of its dependencies.
(3)(ii)
Building from within Eclipse (more complex):

    (a)Install Eclipse and JDK 7.
    (b)Assuming that you checked out the code into synoptic/, you can now import an "existing project" into Eclipse from synoptic/synoptic/.
    Import the 'synoptic' project into Eclipse. Eclipse will fail to locate jar dependencies because the project depends on a SYNOPTIC_LIB variable. This variable specifies where external jars can be found on the local file system. Define and set this variable by doing the following:
        (c)Right click on your project and select Properties
        (d)Select Java Build Path and then the Libraries tab
        (e)Select Add Variable...
        (f)Select Configure Variables...
        (g)Select New...
        (h)Give the variable the name SYNOPTIC_LIB
        (i)Select Folder..., and navigate to synoptic/lib/
        (j)Select OK, and then another OK.
        (k)Select your new variable from the list, click on Extend...
        (l)Navigate to and include the following jar files from synoptic/lib/ for: junit, plume, daikon, json
        (m)Import the 'daikonizer' project into Eclipse (note: synoptic depends on daikonizer).
        You will need to follow the steps above to add a SYNOPTIC_LIB variable and specify a dependency on synoptic/lib/daikon.jar
        (n)You should see that the build.xml file has errors (if not, skip this step). Fix this by disabling all buildfile errors: under Preferences -> Ant -> Editor, in the tab Problems, check "Ignore all buildfile problems".
        (o)Build both synoptic and daikonizer projects from Eclipse. This should produce .class files in synoptic/synoptic/bin/.

Finally, you will want to test your build:

(4)Run one of the following two (equivalent) commands from within synoptic/
        synoptic.sh -h
        java -cp ./lib/*:./synoptic/bin/ synoptic.main.SynopticMain -h
(5)Confirm that the execution outputs a help/usage screen
